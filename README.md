# EchocalypseLinkHelper

This project is a web app for the game Echocalypse. The goal of this web application is to help a player get all the correct `Assist units` for their squads.
The player chooses `6` squad members from the list and press the `Submit` button.
A list of `Cases` is then generated and ordered by highest weightage.

Weightage is done by ATK > HP > The Rest
